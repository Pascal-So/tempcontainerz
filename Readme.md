# Convenient Docker Containers

* not secure
* not necessarily up-to-date
* convenient during development

## How to use

1. Build the containers with `./build.sh`.
2. Add the `scripts` directory to your `PATH`.
3. Start useful temporary containers with the `tempcontainerz-*` commands.

The main goal here is just to not have to install all that stuff like node and apache on my actual machine.
